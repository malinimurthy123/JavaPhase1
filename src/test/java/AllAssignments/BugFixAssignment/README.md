As a developer, fix the bugs in the application using the appropriate algorithmic techniques.

Background of the problem statement:

You have been assigned a few tasks during the sprint planning. Solving the bugs raised by the testing team is one among them. You are given the boilerplate code and are asked to complete it by fixing the bugs.

Bugs to be fixed:

Add the missing source code to the application based on searching technique. Find the appropriate comments to code for the searching technique.
Write source code for sorting the predefined array and ensure the functionality of the application. Find the appropriate comments to code for sorting the predefined array.
You can download the boilerplate code by executing the command below in your git bash.
git clone https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Full-Stack---The-Desk-Application-.git



You must use the following:

Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application
Java: A programming language to develop the prototype
Git: To connect and push files from local system to GitHub
GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions
Search and Sort techniques: Select the relevant data structure algorithms to fix the bugs
Following requirements should be met:

The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repositories. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in the Google Docs.
The link of your GitHub repository is must. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in the Google Docs.
